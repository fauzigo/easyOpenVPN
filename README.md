# OpenVPN 

Provides flexible VPN solutions to secure your data communications, whether it's for Internet privacy, remote access for employees, securing IoT, or for networking Cloud data centers.
Our VPN Server software solution can be deployed on-premises using standard servers or virtual appliances, or on the cloud.

# TL;DR

This repo is supposed to help out the creation of a OpenVPN server's configuration file along with the clients configuration files and certs.

You would normaly do this with easy-rsa, but this is a little more direct and sinple. 

Downsides of this is that clients would be able to login into the server without usernames/passwords. It might get done in the future.



# Usage

```
# ./easyOpenVPN.sh -h
Usage: ./easyOpenVPN.sh [-i|--init </etc/openvpn>] [-c|--client <client> </etc/openvpn>] [-r|--revoke </path/to/cert> ]

  -i|--init would create a CA and server certs along with a default config file for OpenVPN
  You may pass along the location were your files will be created. A folder within said directory will be created <path>/server

  -c|--client would create a folder with all the necessary to start the client
  clients require a name.

  -r|--revoke-client would revoke a client's cert given the common name of the cert
```


This might not work for everyone else, but it might help others.


# Files

You can edit the script file directly, or you can add all required parameters in the vars.yaml file.


# Requirements

* openvpn
* openssl
* yq, which also requires jq


# Considerations 

This comes without any warraty, use at your own risk.
